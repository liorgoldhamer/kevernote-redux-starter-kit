You can check out a demo right now at http://kevernote.herokuapp.com. Use this demo to figure out how to implement the following features:\n1. [Layout] Present a 3-column view containing:\n  * Action Bar\n  * Note List\n  * Note View\n2. [Note Preview] The Note List should include a list of note previews. The note preview should include the title of the note and the first 100 characters of the note’s body without line breaks. If the note’s body is longer than 100 characters, it should show the first 97 characters followed by three dots.\n3. [Note Count] The Note List should indicate the number of notes in it.\n4. [Note Selection] Clicking on a note in the Note List should display that note in the Note View and mark it as selected in the Note List.\n5. [Editing] The title and body of a note should be editable in the Note View. Changing the title ofr the body of the note in the Note View should be reflected immediately in the Note List preview.\n6. [New Note] The action column should include a button for creating a new note. When creating a new note, it should be added to the top of the Note List and automatically be selected. It should also be presented in the Note View. The new note should be persisted in the backend.\n7. [Delete Note] The Note View should include a button for deleting notes. The note should be deleted from the backend.\n8. [Persistence Status] The Note View should include the note’s persistence status. When you type into a note, it should change the status of the note to “Editing”. 2 seconds after you finish typing, it should change to “Saving” and save the note in the backend. Once the note is saved, the status should be changed to “Saved”.\n9. [Distance in Time] The note preview within the Note List should indicate the distance in time from the second the note was created.\n    dfsdfsd","format":null,"created_at":"2015-07-29T07:28:22.644Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T18:07:44.109Z"},{"id":80,"title":"Architecture Restrictions","body":"\nWe want to keep things simple in this task, so please keep the following in mind when designing your app:\n1.
